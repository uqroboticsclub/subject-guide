review = {
    CSSE4010 is a interesting subject and teaches the concepts of FPGA and how they work in real applications. The practical assignments due each week (which resemble those in CSSE3010) are equally as time consuming but do teach the majority of the content.\\
    The final project is normally quite easy, and uses all of the pracs to create something larger scale. \\
    The final exam seems to change format often, however is normally fairly easy to do well on. \\
